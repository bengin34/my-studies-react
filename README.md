# How can your friends push this repo
If you want your friend to push a file to your repository, there are a few steps they will need to follow:

Ask them to fork your repository: Your friend will need to create a fork of your repository by clicking the "Fork" button on your repository's page. This will create a copy of your repository in their GitHub account.

Clone the forked repository: Next, your friend will need to clone the forked repository to their local machine using a Git client, such as Git Bash, GitKraken, or GitHub Desktop.

Create a new branch: In the cloned repository, your friend should create a new branch using the Git client. They can do this by running the command git checkout -b branch-name, where branch-name is the name they want to give to the new branch.

Make changes and commit them: Your friend can now make changes to the files they want to push to your repository. They can add, delete, or modify files as needed. Once they are done, they should commit the changes with a descriptive commit message.

Push changes to the forked repository: With the changes committed, your friend should now push the changes to their forked repository by running the command git push origin branch-name, where branch-name is the name of the branch they created in step 3.

Create a pull request: Finally, your friend should create a pull request by navigating to your repository's page and clicking the "New pull request" button. They should select their branch as the source branch and your repository's main branch as the target branch. They can then submit the pull request for your review.

Once you receive the pull request, you can review the changes your friend made and decide whether to merge them into your repository.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
